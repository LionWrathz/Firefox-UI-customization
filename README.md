# Firefox UI customization

Changing Firefox interface with userChrome.css and userContent.css.	

## Features

- centered URL
- top of the page centered findbar
- subtle tab separators
- tab close button on hover
- dark thin scrollbars
- dark JS alerts/prompts
- context menus cleaned up
- bookmarks bar on newtab page on hover
- background image on newtab page

Some colors might be hardcoded to match the theme I use ([ArcDark](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/)).

## Installing

Copy contents into `yourFirefoxProfile\chrome` folder. 

`yourFirefoxProfile` can be accessed from `about:support -> Profile Folder`.

## Examples

Min/max/close buttons stand out because on my Windows 8.1 they are controlled by OS and cannot be changed by Firefox.
