# Firefox UI customization

Changing Firefox interface with userChrome.css and userContent.css.	

## Features

- centered URL
- top of the page centered findbar
- subtle tab separators
- tab close button on hover
- dark thin scrollbars
- dark JS alerts/prompts
- context menus cleaned up
- bookmarks bar on newtab page on hover
- background image on newtab page

Some colors might be hardcoded to match the theme I use ([ArcDark](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/)), 

## Installing

Copy contents into [yourFirefoxProfile]/chrome folder. 
[yourFirefoxProfile] can be accessed from **about:support** -> Profile Folder.
